  Version 0.2 released.

  This version dramatically speeds up the computation of the hard
  special leaves (up to 10x faster). The speed up comes from the
  implementation of a special binary tree data structure for summing
  the unsieved numbers in O(log n) operations as well as other low
  level optimizations.

  Version 0.1 released.

  This is the first version of primesum. It uses the Deleglise-Rivat
  algorithm to compute the sum of the primes below x. primesum
  currently uses the __int128_t integer type so it will work correctly
  up to 10^20, above 10^20 the prime sum > 2^128.
