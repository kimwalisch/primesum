  Version 1.3 work in progress.

  primesum now supports 256-bit results by default! So now there is
  only one primesum version for both 128-bit and 256-bit results.
  This version has been optimized so that it uses 128-bit arithmetic
  for numbers < 2^63 and 256-bit arithmetic for numbers >= 2^63.

  * S2_hard.cpp: Get rid of binary indexed tree.
  * P2.cpp: Optimize 128-bit and 256-bit arithmetic.
  * S1.cpp: Optimize 128-bit and 256-bit arithmetic.
  * phi_sum.cpp: Optimize 128-bit and 256-bit arithmetic.
  * S2_easy.cpp: Optimize 128-bit and 256-bit arithmetic.
  * S2_trivial.cpp: Reduce memory usage.
  * BitSieve.cpp: Increase bit sieve compression to 16 numbers per
                  byte (previously 8 numbers per byte).

  Version 1.2 released.

  This version fixes an integer overflow in primesum 128-bit
  and speeds up primesum 256-bit by up to 30% due to replacing the
  Boost multiprecision library with my own highly optimized
  int256_t type.

  * int256_t.hpp: New 256-bit signed integer type.
  * Fix 128-bit integer overflow in phi_sum.cpp.
  * Reduce input limit from 10^20 to 2^64-1 in primesum 128-bit.
  * CMakeLists.txt: Silence OpenMP warning.
  * README.md: Update build instructions.
  * .travis.yml: Update to Ubuntu 14.

  Version 1.1 released.

  * CMake: Use CMake build system instead of Autotools.
  * README.md: New 256-bit binaries.

  Version 1.0 released.

  This release adds a new 256-bits branch which allows to compute
  prime sums for values of x > 10^20.

  Version 0.2 released.

  This version dramatically speeds up the computation of the hard
  special leaves (up to 10x faster). The speed up comes from the
  implementation of a special binary tree data structure for summing
  the unsieved numbers in O(log n) operations as well as other low
  level optimizations.

  Version 0.1 released.

  This is the first version of primesum. It uses the Deleglise-Rivat
  algorithm to compute the sum of the primes below x. primesum
  currently uses the __int128_t integer type so it will work correctly
  up to 10^20, above 10^20 the prime sum > 2^128.
