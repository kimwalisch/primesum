/// @file  S2LoadBalancer.cpp
/// @brief The S2LoadBalancer evenly distributes the work load between
///        the threads in the computation of the special leaves.
///
/// Simply parallelizing the computation of the special leaves in the
/// Lagarias-Miller-Odlyzko and Deleglise-Rivat algorithms by
/// subdividing the sieve interval by the number of threads into
/// equally sized subintervals does not scale because the distribution
/// of the special leaves is highly skewed and most special leaves are
/// in the first few segments whereas later on there are very few
/// special leaves.
///
/// Based on the above observations it is clear that we need some kind
/// of load balancing in order to scale our parallel algorithm for
/// computing special leaves. Below are the ideas I used to develop a
/// load balancing algorithm that achieves a high load balance by
/// dynamically increasing or decreasing the interval size based on
/// the relative standard deviation of the thread run-times.
///
/// 1) Start with a tiny segment size of x^(1/3) / (log x * log log x)
///    and one segment per thread. Our algorithm uses equally sized
///    intervals, for each thread the interval_size is
///    segment_size * segments_per_thread and the threads process
///    adjacent intervals i.e.
///    [base + interval_size * thread_id, base + interval_size * (thread_id + 1)].
///
/// 2) If the relative standard deviation of the thread run-times is
///    large then we know the special leaves are distributed unevenly,
///    else if the relative standard deviation is low the special
///    leaves are more evenly distributed.
///
/// 3) If the special leaves are distributed unevenly then we can
///    increase the load balance by decreasing the interval_size.
///    Contrary if the special leaves are more evenly distributed
///    we can increase the interval_size in order to improve the
///    algorithm's efficiency.
///
/// 4) We can't use a static threshold for as to when the relative
///    standard deviation is low or large as this threshold varies for
///    different PC architectures. So instead we compare the current
///    relative standard deviation to the previous one in order to
///    decide whether to increase or decrease the interval_size.
